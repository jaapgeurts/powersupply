# Variable power supply

This project is my first attempt at a variable voltage power supply with current limiting.

The power supply can regulate from 0-25v and handle about 3 Amps depending on how well the series pass transistor is heatsinked.

Regulation is not very stable when current limiting kicks in. This requires further analysis.

If you've built and/or improved this project I would like to hear from you.

**Warning**

I make no guarantees towards the correctness or quality of this project.

If you decide to build this project and use this power supply, you do so at your own risk.
